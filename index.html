            Today I watched birds for 2 hours straight, ate some melon, governed
            the Chiku Kingdom, and then went into hibernation. Honestly, they
            should make me the president of United States of America. After my nap,
            I found a shiny pebble that looked like a diamond, so I claimed it as
            royal property. Later, I sat by the window pretending to be a philosopher
            cat, staring at the moon and questioning why humans still don't serve
            breakfast twice.

            Dear Diary, today I played with a new friend. They call it a
            sunflower. It's yellow in color and all the bees are excited. They
            put the sunflower on a raft and sailed the ocean for eons to come!
            I watched from my throne aka the living room sofa as the bees buzzed
            in circles, clearly impressed by my calm composure. Later, I tried to
            take a nap under the window, but the sunlight was too perfect, so I
            just stretched, yawned, and pretended I owned the sun.
